vapCycleCalc is a simple app that was created to help students analyze 
Rankine cycles. The idea behind the app is to provide a simple and 
accessible tool that makes the analysis process easier and more 
intuitive. vapCycleCalc has two key features, the first feature 
allows you to draw a Rankine cycle on your mobile device 
(right now it is limited to just simple Rankine cycle), 
providing a clear visual representation of the cycle. 
The second feature includes is a calculator that help you analyze 
the cycle, gain time and look for the values that results in a 
good efficiency.
